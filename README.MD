<ul>
  <li>This project was built on Laravel API with Vue</li>
  <li>This project was inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://web.facebook.com/BlackOkumura/videos/1265385833603495/">this Facebook post</a> when I scroll my facebook timeline last week :))</li>
  <li>Since original PokeAPI having problems on CORS, this project using mirrored verison of PokeAPI <a href="pokeapi.salestock.net/api/v2/" target="_blank">(http:pokeapi.salestock.net)</a></li>
  <li>Thanks to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp">Jimp</a>. this library is very useful to crop empty space from pokemon image sprites resulted from PokeAPI, because it has different scaling with each other pokemon until it cropped</li>
